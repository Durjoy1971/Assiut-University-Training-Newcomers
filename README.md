## How to Traverse

1. **Open the file** – Click any link in the tables above to open the corresponding Markdown file in your editor.
2. **Use relative paths** – All links are relative to this `README.md`, ensuring they work regardless of where the repository is cloned.
3. **Search within files** – Most editors support `Ctrl+F` (Windows) to quickly find keywords inside a Markdown document.
4. **Generate a local Table of Contents** – Many editors (e.g., VS Code) can display a document outline based on headings (`#`, `##`, etc.). Use this to jump between sections.

## Adding New Markdown Files

- Place the new file in the appropriate folder.
- Add an entry to the relevant table above, following the same format.
